QSol‑Standard‑ZKProofs‑v1.0
Zero‑Knowledge Proof Systems Standard
QSol LLC — Harmonic Systems Research Division
Description
The ZKProofs‑v1.0 Standard defines the formal cryptographic framework for zero‑knowledge proof systems in the QSol Integrity Suite, covering interactive proofs, sigma‑protocols, PCPs, SNARKs, and polynomial commitments to ensure rigorous, auditable, long‑term cryptographic integrity.

This standard provides a rigorous, auditable foundation for secure, privacy‑preserving cryptographic applications.

Part of the QSol Integrity Standards Suite
This standard is one component of the broader QSol cryptographic and harmonic integrity framework:

THCS Standard v1.0 — Harmonic Stability & Convergence

ZPk Standard v1.0 — Zero‑Knowledge Kernel Architecture

ZKProofs Standard v1.0 — (this document)

Together, these form the QSol Integrity Standards Suite, establishing a unified, mathematically grounded foundation for secure, deterministic, and privacy‑preserving computation.

Contents
This standard includes formal definitions, mathematical foundations, and institutional‑grade structures for:

Sigma‑Protocols

Probabilistically Checkable Proofs (PCPs)

SNARKs and succinct arguments

Polynomial Commitment Schemes

Governance, compliance, and auditability

Secure protocol design

Blockchain and distributed systems
